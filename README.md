# tinybot-autopilot
Driver program for tiny self-driving car that follows a line track and goes around stationary/moving obstacles in its path. Uses Raspberry Pi4 microcontroller and various sensors 

Note: This project was completed for a school project, however, I am currently working on implementing obstacle avoidance by adding Lidar and inter-process communication to make improvements.
